## In a nutshell...
* [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is cool
* use requirements.txt (for pip) or environment.yml (for conda) to setup the python environment.
  * use conda where OS files (e.g., proj for Cartopy) are also needed
* postBuild: run code after build
  * e.g., download (wget) additional files you may need within your container
